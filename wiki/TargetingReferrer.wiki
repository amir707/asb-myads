What is referrer?

When a web surfer lands on a page with an ad tag referrer is the URL from which the web surfer was directed to your page. 

For example: user clicks on a your Google Ad Words PPC banner in Google search results and lands on your home page with banners served by ASB MyAds. Referrer is the URL that brought Google search results and where the click occurred that directed the user to your site. 

So targeting by referrer is a very valuable feature. You can target users by traffic sources as they are listed in your Google Analytics report.
