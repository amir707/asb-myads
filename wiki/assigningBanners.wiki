#summary Describes how to assign banners to ad places.

= Assigning Banners =

You should create a banner in the right panel and then drag it to a paddock of an ad place. As a result the banner is cloned. The binding between the original and the cloned banner still exists. The banner is identified by:
<ul>
<li>banner name</li>
<li>banner file</li>
</ul>
That means if you change banner name or banner file of the original banner it will be automatically changed in all cloned banners.
All other banners settings are independent for each banner.

==Example==
You have a banner that you want to display on 3 ad places and you want to limit total number of views for this banner to 100,000. 

==Solution==
Create a banner and drag and drop it to 3 ad places. In banner settings (Targeting->Capping) set 'maximum number of views for the whole display period' to 33,333 for each cloned/dropped banner.
