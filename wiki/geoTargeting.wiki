#summary Describes how geo targeting works in ASB MyAds.

= Geo Targeting =

We are using a free ip-to-country datatabase available at <a href="http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/node/view/6">http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/node/view/6</a>.

Determining whether to serve the banner is implemented in db/procs/is_valid_country.sql


== NOTE ==
We are refactoring geo targeting by country to use MaxMind's GeoLite Country (http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry) and adding GeoLite City (http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity) .
