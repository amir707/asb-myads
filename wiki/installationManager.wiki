#summary Describes how to use installation manager.

= Installation Manager =

IM provides the following functionality:
  * setting the number of instances
  * setting custom MySQL username/password

IM *does not* allow any of the following:
  * removing or clearing any of the database intances

So IM is pretty safe. Only incremental database updates are possible. 

For IM to appear any of the following should happen:
  * software update or first install that requires db schema update or creation. Software update occurs during the deployment of a new version. 
  * db.update.required is set to 'true' in {{{<UserHome>/.dbProperties}}} file created by ASB MyAds

Requirements:
  * database server (MySQL) should contain a user that has permissions to create databases
  * MySQL 5.1.{{*}} + (with support for stored procedures and triggers)
  * database server should be running on localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3306 (default) - we currently do not have this setting in the installer
